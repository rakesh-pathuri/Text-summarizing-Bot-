Text summarization integrated as a Telegram Bot can be a powerful and convenient tool to provide concise and relevant 
summaries of long pieces of text to users directly within the Telegram messaging app. By integrating text 
summarization as a Telegram Bot, you empower users to quickly get the key points of lengthy documents, news 
articles, or other textual content without leaving the messaging app, which can be especially beneficial for users who 
want quick access to important information on the go.
